Stuart Broad says it "doesn't matter" which bowlers England play if they fail to post big first-innings scores.

The tourists were bowled out for 147, 236 and 185 in the first innings as they lost the first three Ashes Tests.

Broad, who played only one of those Tests, took 5-101 in the fourth as Australia declared on 416-8 and England closed day two on 13-0 in Sydney.

"You can dissect loads on this trip, but first-innings runs is where you live in Test cricket," said Broad.

"We've failed to deliver that. It doesn't matter what bowlers you play if you're getting bowled out for 140. That might be a bit brutal, but that's the truth in Test cricket."
In a wide-ranging media conference, 35-year-old Broad also discussed his desire to continue playing Test cricket and a "realistic" ambition to be part of the next Ashes series at home in 2023, and urged England to change their planning to not look too far ahead into the future.

Broad's only previous match in this series was the second Test in Adelaide. After England were beaten by 275 runs in that match, captain Joe Root publicly criticised his attack for bowling too short.

England have not yet posted a total of 300 in any innings, while only four batters - Root, Dawid Malan, Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes - have made more than 100 runs across the series.

Broad, who was part of the England side that won in Australia in 2010-11, added: "I said in an interview eight months ago that, coming to Australia, first-innings runs are everything.
